# MythicBotany

Documentation coming soon. Project is WIP

### Notes:

If minecraft refuses to start **and only if it refuses to start** you might want to run

```
gradle setup
```
  
<hr>
  
The pattern that is required under the ManaInfuser is

sgs
gsg
sgs

s = shimmerrock
g = gold block

Unlike the terra plate you need a dominant spark upgrade to use it with sparks.

<hr>

Rune Spells are not done yet. There are only a few combinations possible now.

Try:

Paper + Rune of Air + Rune of Spring + Rune of Sloth

You need a mana-tablet for it to work.
Activate via rightclik.
